# Mobile Stability Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive mobile stability improvements to eliminate scroll/viewport bugs and layout breakage across iOS, Android, and iPadOS devices.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Global CSS Baseline (`src/index.css`)
- ✅ Added universal `box-sizing: border-box`
- ✅ Implemented safe area insets for notched devices
- ✅ Removed problematic `overflow-x: hidden` from global containers
- ✅ Added `overscroll-behavior-y: auto` for natural rubber-banding
- ✅ Global image/video responsive rules
- ✅ Added viewport height utilities with `dvh` support and fallbacks

### 2. Scroll Hijacking Fixes (`src/hooks/useScrollHijack.tsx`)
- ✅ Desktop-only scroll hijacking (disabled on touch devices)
- ✅ Passive event listeners for better scroll performance
- ✅ Natural scrolling preserved on mobile devices
- ✅ Removed body scroll lock on mobile

### 3. Viewport Units & Heights
- ✅ Hero: Converted fixed heights to fluid `min-h-[min(92vh,XXXpx)]`
- ✅ Projects carousel: Mobile-responsive height with `min-h-[min(85vh,500px)]`
- ✅ Added `dvh` viewport unit support with `vh` fallbacks

### 4. Button Accessibility
- ✅ Added `type="button"` to all interactive buttons
- ✅ Increased touch target sizes to 44x44px minimum
- ✅ Added `touch-none` class for navigation controls

### 5. Image Performance
- ✅ Hero image: `fetchPriority="high"` for LCP optimization
- ✅ Other images: `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"`
- ✅ Features, CommunityMap, Footer images optimized

### 6. Cookie Banner Mobile Fix
- ✅ Changed from `position: fixed` to `position: sticky` on mobile
- ✅ Desktop preserves original fixed positioning
- ✅ No longer blocks page scroll on mobile

### 7. Motion Preferences
- ✅ Respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- ✅ Disables animations for accessibility

## Testing Matrix
